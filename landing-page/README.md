# This project was amazing

It made work hard and learn how to use functions to make my work easier. After this project I now can manipulate the dom ;
"# Landing-Page"  git init git add README.md git commit -m "first commit" git branch -M main git remote add origin https://github.com/ahmed-kashkous/Landing-Page.git git push -u origin main
"# Landing-Page"
